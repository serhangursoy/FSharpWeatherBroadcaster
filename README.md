# Weather Broadcaster
This is an F# project that I made for learning the basics of F#. Feel free to use in any of your project. I'm frankly sorry about the ugly-looking UI. What this project does is that it simply gets Weather information in JSON format from openweathermap API and shows that to user in a proper manner. 
**You need to Sign-in to openweathermap in order to get your API Key**
